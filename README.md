Student Exam Portal Database

This project contains a structured SQL database for managing students, courses, exams, and results. It was built as part of an internship assignment focused on schema design, normalization, and relational integrity.

ðŸ“¦ Files

- schema.sql: Creates the database and defines all tables with primary and foreign keys.
- data.sql: Inserts sample data for testing and demonstration.
- README.md: Overview of the project and usage instructions.

ðŸ—ƒ Tables Overview

- Students: Basic student info
- Courses: Course details and instructors
- Exams: Linked to courses via foreign key
- Results: Links students to exam scores

ðŸš€ How to Use

1. Run schema.sql to set up the database.
